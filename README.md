# How to Get Started: Follow This Process

# DT L&D Backend Base

The **DT L&D Backend Base** is the base foundation designed to support the Learning and Development (L&D) process within the organization. This project serves as the backbone, providing essential functionalities and a structured architecture that facilitates seamless extension and completion of tasks throughout the L&D journey.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- NPM (Node Package Manager): NPM comes bundled with Node.js.

## Steps to Set Up Project Configuration

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/deepthoughtEdu/backend-base.git
   cd backend-base
   ```

2. **Create the Configuration File:**
   Go to the project's root directory and create a file named `config.json`.

   ```javascript
   {
       "port": 3000,
       "env": "<Development_Environment>", // Can be either "development" or "production"
       "mongoUri": "<Your_MongoDB_Connection_String>",
       "database": "backend-base",
       "cookieSecret": "<Cookie_Secret_String>"
   }
   ```

   - **`port`:** Set the port number where your application will run. The default is `3000`.
   - **`env`:** Specify the environment for your application (`development`, `production`, etc.).
   - **`mongoUri`:** Provide the MongoDB connection string for your database.
   - **`database`:** Set the name of your MongoDB database.
   - **`cookieSecret`:** Enter a secure secret key for handling cookies and sessions.

3. **Save the Configuration File:**
   Save the changes you made to the `config.json` file.

4. **Install Dependencies:**
   If there are new dependencies mentioned in the project's `package.json` file, install them using the following command:
   ```bash
   npm install # Installs all the dependencies in one go
   ```

5. **Start the Application:**
   Run the following command to start your backend application:
   ```bash
   npm start # Typically used while the app runs in production mode
   
   npm run dev # Run a development server along with nodemon
   ```

   Your application is now configured and ready to run with the specified properties.

## Additional Notes

- **Security Note:**
  Ensure that sensitive information, such as database connection strings and secret keys, is kept secure. Avoid storing such information directly in version control systems.

- **Troubleshooting:**
  If you encounter issues during the configuration process, refer to the project's documentation or seek help from the development team.
